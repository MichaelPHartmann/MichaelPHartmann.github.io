		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<div class="divline"></div>
			I'm a little bit of a jack-of-all-trades and my work history is certainly proof of that but it only tells part of the story.
			In all my trades and hobbies and practices a common thread connects things;
			and that is a chance to solve problems, shift my understanding, learn something new, and work with my hands.

			Personally my hobbies include photography, coffee, motorcycles, travel, and generally making/breaking things.
			Professionally I have experience that spans customer service, food service, construction, and software development.
