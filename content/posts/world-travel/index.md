In the first five-ish months of my solo travels I kept a fairly detailed journal about where I was, what I was doing, and what I thought about it.
Often these were written about each and every day.
I had intended to keep writing these but as you can tell from the POSTS on this site, that never happened.
It's time intensive and I really felt like they started to feel same-y.
There is no story, just a direct relation of things as they were.

I would like to write more in depth about many of the places I have been and intend to do so after more thought or after an in person revisitation.
For now I think it would be nice to at least put down a Record of Travel.
In other words a timeline of the places I've been, perhaps accompanied with a short sentence or two, but not neccesarily.
This will mirror the day planner I've used to track my travels,
in which, for each day, I write down the city I'm in and maybe one thing I did that day.
I won't go day by day but I'll list the interesting things under each city.
If there were trips to other cities while I was living in one place, the main city of stay will be listed first chronologically.

For now it's going to be pretty basic, but maybe I'll find a way to make it a little more visually interesting.
Countries are listed in reverse chronological order.
Cities are listed in chronological order.
