I've been all over the place in the last couple years, and my bag has changed a lot in that time.
I __*[originally wrote about what I was packing at the beginning of my travels](/posts/)*__
and I thought a follow up would be interesting.
I've added a few things and taken some away and compared to my original post I'll be going into more detail about why I chose each item.

I've traveled through Asia, Australia, India, North Africa and Europe
through all parts of the year so I need a diverse range of clothing for all temperatures and experiences.
I also don't love doing laundry in a sink so I tend to pack a little more clothing to make laundry trips less frequent.
Because I don't really have a home base available (or at least my stored things are in Canada and not easily accesible)
I also need to carry basically everything I need.
I can't switch things out based on the location and since
I was also outside of Canada for up to 11 months at a time so "going without" an item for a couple weeks wasn't possible either.

What I'm saying is this backpack has had to act as a home in a bag.
It's got prety much everything I need for day to day life,
and while others certainly have done this wih less, in smaller bags
I'm not too concerned about that.
I don't fly unless its trans-continental so the carry on size is fine and I have no real reason to go smaller.

## Notable Changes From The Start Of My Travels

Most of the changes I made came after the first six-month stint of travel.
At that point I returned to Canada for the summer and took some time to reorganize my packing solutions.
I picked up a few things while travelling like new jackets and a tote bag but after that summer things remained pretty similar.

The most notable change has been with the actual bags I'm using.
I started with a duffel back and small backpack combo and after the first six months I realized that it was too much hassle to handle both of them.
I originally went for a small backpack because having it while in a city for a while for day trips and stuff would be useful.
This was true in those situations but the truh is most of my travel involves changing places once or twice a week so it was more annoying than beneficial.

After the first six months I switched to using one backpack that is the absolute maximum size for a carry on.
As I hinted above I'm mostly on trains and buses, so the only real concern I have with size is how comfortable it is to walk between accomodations.
I did buy a tote bag from Muji that could be used for day outings and this was more than sufficient.
It carried my laptop, water bottle, and notebook perfectly so the backpack was definitely overkill.

I also got rid of the keyboard and condensed my charging bricks and cables into a single GaN charger which I'll talk about below.
I didn't use the keyboard much because it's really only useful if it can be setup and stay setup for days at a time,
rather than packing it up every day.
I didn't miss it once so I know this was a good decision.
