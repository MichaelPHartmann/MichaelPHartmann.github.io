I've been all over the place in the last couple years, and my bag has changed a lot in that time.
I __*[originally wrote about what I was packing at the beginning of my travels](/posts/packing-list/)*__
and I thought a follow up would be interesting.
I've added a few things and taken some away and compared to my original post I'll be going into more detail about why I chose each item.

I've traveled through Asia, Australia, India, North Africa and Europe
through all parts of the year so I need a diverse range of clothing for all temperatures and experiences.
I also don't love doing laundry in a sink so I tend to pack a little more clothing to make laundry trips less frequent.
Because I don't really have a home base available (or at least my stored things are in Canada and not easily accesible)
I also need to carry basically everything I need.
I can't switch things out based on the location and since
I was also outside of Canada for up to 11 months at a time so "going without" an item for a couple weeks wasn't possible either.

What I'm saying is this backpack has had to act as a home in a bag.
It's got prety much everything I need for day to day life,
and while others certainly have done this wih less, in smaller bags
I'm not too concerned about that.
I don't fly unless its trans-continental so the carry on size is fine and I have no real reason to go smaller.

## Notable Changes From The Start Of My Travels

Most of the changes I made came after the first six-month stint of travel.
At that point I returned to Canada for the summer and took some time to reorganize my packing solutions.
I picked up a few things while travelling like new jackets and a tote bag but after that summer things remained pretty similar.

The most notable change has been with the actual bags I'm using.
I started with a duffel back and small backpack combo and after the first six months I realized that it was too much hassle to handle both of them.
I originally went for a small backpack because having it while in a city for a while for day trips and stuff would be useful.
This was true in those situations but the truh is most of my travel involves changing places once or twice a week so it was more annoying than beneficial.

After the first six months I switched to using one backpack that is the absolute maximum size for a carry on.
As I hinted above I'm mostly on trains and buses, so the only real concern I have with size is how comfortable it is to walk between accomodations.
I did buy a tote bag from Muji that could be used for day outings and this was more than sufficient.
It carried my laptop, water bottle, and notebook perfectly so the backpack was definitely overkill.

I also got rid of the keyboard and condensed my charging bricks and cables into a single GaN charger which I'll talk about below.
I didn't use the keyboard much because it's really only useful if it can be setup and stay setup for days at a time,
rather than packing it up every day.
I didn't miss it once so I know this was a good decision.

## What I'd Change Next Time

While I'm pretty happy with the way this bag was packed there are probably a few things I'd change.
The bulkiest part of the whole setup is the clothing, by far, and so I would definitely trim some items.
The biggest reason for carrying as many clothes as I do is to avoid doing laundry too often but I think I can embrace the sink laundry life with a littl more planning.
To start I would add a mesh laundry bag.
These are incredibly light and compact and make washing clothes in a sink SO much easier.
If I could do a load of laundry consisting of one shirt, two pairs of underwear, and two pairs of socks every other day I think that would be good enough.
I can wash everything including pants in real laundry machine every two weeks or so.

This would mean I can cut down on the number of clothes I carry.
To start with I had too many shirts, and at the same time not enough variety.
I would go down from seven t-shirts to three and add in a button up shirt that can be dressed up for a night out, date, or party.
This would mean re-wearing my shirts more often but with a sink wash 4 shirts should be plenty to rotate through.
I would also cut the number of underwear and socks I pack, from ten and eight respectively to five of each. 
For pants and shorts I am pretty happy with two of each, but for shorter trips or single weather trips just one or the other would be fine.
No point in bringing shorts to Kazakhstan in November.

Beyond clothing I would also cut down on the little cords and stuff I accumulated along the trip.
One long 2M USB C to USB C cable, and one each of a 50cm USB C to USB C and USB A to USB C would do the trick.
Adding to this was less of a concious decision and more just circumstances bringing new cables into my life.
Things like the camera battery charger are USB A to Micro USB which sucks, but just is what it is,
although I may look at modifying the charger to use USB C.

Some other things I would add would be more social items to complement the Dutch Blitz card game:

- Six Dice (D6)
- Deck of Cards

Having these with me gives some flexibility to create social settings in hostels and while it adds a bit of bulk they would probably be well used.

If possible I would shrink the size of my bag, but that's not a need.
The only reason this would be nice is for motorcycle travel which I plan to do much more of in the future.
Having a thirty-ish litre bag would be easier to strap to a bike or repack into saddle bags.
The smaller size may also make it possible to carry the whole bag around on a day trip or layover and be small enough to squeeze into a bus overhead shelf.
Other than that I think with the above changes I would have almost the perfect travel bag setup,
being able to carry on to any flight, stash anywhere, slide into any locker and lug around with ease.
It is cerainly possible to go smaller and lighter and I'll experiment with that for shorter trips but for me the setup I've described fits my needs perfectly.
