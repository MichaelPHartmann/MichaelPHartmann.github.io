Every newspaper, magazine, and content creator has some version of a style guide.
This might look like rules discussed by writers and formalized on paper
or just preferences by someone about how the wish to layout a page.
The purpose of this document is not to be a complete set of rules for my own writing
but a collection of ideas and principles by which I would like to abide.
It's nit-picky and in the grand scheme of things *does not matter*.

If you find something on this site that is not in accordance with this style guide
please do not hesitate to reach out to me.

## Numbers

- Should almost always be written out in their full spelling
- i.e. **30** should always be written as **thirty**
- an exception would be in mathematical notation or in some dates

## Dates

- Shall always have the day first, followed by the month then year
- Writing the date shall be spelled out (**forty** instead of **40**)
- Statistics (like post information) it can be a numeral but shall include leading zeroes
- Can be italicized for readability and the distinguish it from surrounding information
- e.x. First of January Twenty Twenty Five
- e.x. 1st January, 2025
- e.x. 01/01/25 or 01/01/2025

## Lists

- List items should not end with a period,
if the item is too long it should be broken into multiple parts or nested
- Should items should start with a capital letter

## General Style

- Oxford comma, always
- Links in sentences should be italicized, bolded, or upper case to distinguish from surrounding content

## Markdown

- Absolute line length does not matter but each sentence should be on it's own line
