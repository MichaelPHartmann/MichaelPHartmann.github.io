<p>They say a jack-of-all-trades but master of none is still better than a master of one. As you may see from my professional experiences in customer service, retail, construction, finance, and tech I certainly fall into the J.O.A.T. category. In all of these pursuits I found common threads that drew me in: a chance to solve challenging problems and opportunities to learn something new.</p>
<p>Personally I also have many hobbies and interests like mechanics, coffee, and software. I&rsquo;m a home mechanic who has been wrenching on my own vehicles since the first week with my first car, a baby-blue 1980 Fiat Spider. I currently just own a 2000 Suzuki SV650 motorcycle, a sort of hybrid between sport and touring, naked and fairing-ed. Whenever I mention my only vehicle is a bike the say a variant of &ldquo;but what if it&rsquo;s raining?&rdquo;. My answer is always &ldquo;then I&rsquo;ll get wet&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s something particularily freeing about accepting discomfort like this, it&rsquo;s okay to be uncomfortable because that&rsquo;s how you learn about yourself.</p>
<p>My other passion is coffee. I&rsquo;ve spent a decent chunk of time working in coffee, but it has been many more years of seeking out, preparing, sharing, and enjoying specialty coffee. One of the things I enjoy most about coffe, and specialty coffee in particular is that all over the world you have a chance to share the experience of an amazing cup that transcends any language barriers. Living in Egypt and travelling to places like Romania, I&rsquo;ve been able to meet great new friends through coffee and it&rsquo;s always something I enjoy. The coffee I tend to drink may be expensive, but I try not to be a snob about it - everyone&rsquo;s taste is different and that&rsquo;s a great thing. Besides, in a choice between no coffee and bad coffee, I&rsquo;ll choose a warm cup of joe any day.</p>
<p>I graduated with a B.B.A. in corporate finance, interested in putting my skills to use performing research and analyses on investments. When I turned to the job market I found banking careers to be sparse in Vancouver, and the connections and credentials required to land them lacking on my end. I turned to my previous summer job in construction where I was invigorated by working with my hands and managing the process of building a house from nothing but a stack of wood. Framing houses is a job I thoroughly enjoyed (although the weather some days tried to solve that) and it is still something I miss doing.</p>
<p>I had been interested in tech and programming since around 2018 when I entered a programming competition called Battlesnake. Competing head-to-head in the classic game of Snake, I coded an &lsquo;AI&rsquo; serpeant and was promptly knocked out in the first round. Through the subsequent years I worked mainly on a pet-project called FinMesh which helped hone my Python and data management skills.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2021 I was given the incredible opportunity to move to Egypt and step back from a job and focus on upgrading my technical skills. The hope was that in a few months I could land an entry-level remote position in tech and leverage that to move into development roles. Through Codeacademy I took several courses in Python, SQL, JavaScript and web design and felt decently equiped to take on a new role. We both figured that with so many companies going &lsquo;remote&rsquo; in the wake of Covid-19, it would simple to find a job.</p>
<p>I submitted hundreds of job applications across all sorts of companies, but it seemed that when companies say &lsquo;remote&rsquo; they actually just mean &lsquo;you need to live in the same city as our office but you can work at home&rsquo;. Not exactly ideal when I live in Egypt. Finally in January of 2022 I accepted a job as a Support Engineer at MonetizeMore and the timing could not have been better. I was less than a week away from booking flights home to go back to work in construction.</p>
<p>Getting to apply my self-taught JavaScript has been challenging and rewarding, and I&rsquo;ve had a chance to dive more into front-end debugging and development. I continue to work on personal projects and learning new things. I&rsquo;m looking forward to studying and investigating new topics soon like C/C++, network protocols, advanced backend engineering, hobby hardware such as ESP32, and Linux From Scratch where I plan to build a custom Linux distro for daily driving.</p>
